	"An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;) . Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use them in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard."

	Suppose if I want a non breaking space between a phrase means it should break if we adjust our window or screen, we use this entity - &ampnbsp; between each and every word in the phrase.
	If we want &copy; this symbol, we use - &ampcopy; entity.
	If we want quotes or this symbol - &quot; &quot; perfectly in any encoding view, we use &ampquot; at the begining and ending of the sentence.
